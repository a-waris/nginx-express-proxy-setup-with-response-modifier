To run the setup using Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are Installed:**
   - Make sure you have Docker installed. You can download it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
   - Ensure Docker Compose is also installed. It's included as part of Docker Desktop for Windows and macOS. For Linux, follow the [installation instructions on the Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

2. **Organize Your Project Directory:**
   - Create a project directory with the following structure:
     ```plaintext
     your-project/
     ├── docker-compose.yml
     ├── nginx-service/
     │   └── nginx.conf
     └── nodejs-service/
         └── index.js
     ```

3. **Configure Your Files:**
   - Place the provided `docker-compose.yml`, `nginx.conf`, and `index.js` files in the respective directories.

4. **Build and Start Your Services:**
   - Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory (`your-project`).
   - Run the following command to build and start your services:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up --build
     ```

5. **Access Your Services:**
   - Once the services are up and running, you can access:
     - Your Node.js service at `http://localhost:3000`.
     - Your Nginx service at `http://localhost`.

6. **Verify the Setup:**
   - Test the routing and string replacement functionality by sending requests to the different endpoints defined in your Nginx configuration.

7. **Shutdown:**
   - When you are done, you can stop the services by pressing `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.
   - Alternatively, you can run the following command in another terminal while in the project directory:
     ```bash
     docker-compose down
     ```

These steps should get your services running in Docker containers, with Nginx proxying requests according to the specified configuration.
